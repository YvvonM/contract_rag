### CONTRACT ADVICER RAG

## Project Structure

This project is divided into two main components: the First Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and the Second RAG. Each RAG is further categorized into a Parent RAG and a Baby RAG. Within each RAG, three key components are addressed:

### First RAG
1. **Making of Chunks and Vector DB:**
   - The initial phase involves creating chunks and establishing the Vector Database.

2. **Making and Enhancing of Retriever:**
   - Focus on developing and improving the Retriever component for effective information retrieval.

3. **Making and Enhancing of Generator:**
   - Dedicated efforts toward creating and enhancing the Generator for generating contextually rich responses.

### Second RAG
1. **Making of Chunks and Vector DB:**
   - Similar to the First RAG, this phase involves crafting chunks and setting up the Vector Database.

2. **Making and Enhancing of Retriever:**
   - Ongoing work on refining and optimizing the Retriever component for superior performance.

3. **Making and Enhancing of Generator:**
   - Continual efforts to develop and enhance the Generator for generating more accurate and context-aware responses.

This structured approach ensures a comprehensive and systematic development process for both Parent and Baby RAGs within the overarching framework of the project.
